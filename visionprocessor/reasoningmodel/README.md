### Overview
Building a reasoning model from an LLM can be a great return-on-investment and involves just reinforcement learning. The fun part is that it can work for both text-to-text LLMs such as GPT3.5/4 and Multi-modal LLMs such as GPT4o. Reasoning models have a dedicated chain-of-thought phase to decompose and logically work through problems before responding. Examples of reasoning models are o4, and Phi but let us review how to do that with drone imagery models for drone sensing applications where an agent can send a drone image to a fine-tuned model to get observations and then send the observations to a reasoning model to get a better analysis. In this example of building a reasoning model, we use Group Relative Policy Optimization aka GRPO technique and use Azure AI Machine Learning platform because it helps with debugging, logging, profiling and metrics. GRPO  is a reinforcement learning technique that compares multiple answers within a group, rewards the best-performing outputs, penalizes poor ones and applies careful updates to avoid sudden changes.
